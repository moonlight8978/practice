# Example
#   t(:welcome)                 # => 'Welcome'
#   t([:welcome, :date_notify]) # => ['...', '...'] (too lazy)
#   t(:hello, scope: [:aad])    # => 'aasdsad'
#   t(:asdsa, default: 'aaa')   # => 'aaa'
#   t(:asdsa, default: [:welcome, 'Both are not found'])
#   # => 'Welcome'

  # DateTime use #l, passing DateTime object and format options
  # Example
  #   l(Date.new(2017, 12, 15), format: :custom) # => '2017-12-15'
  date:
    formats:

  # Example
  #   t(:artists, count: 0) # => 'no artists'
  #   t(:artists, count: 5) # => '5 artists'
  artists:
    zero: 'no artists'
    one: '1 artist'
